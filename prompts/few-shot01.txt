"You will judge the clarity of an answer to a journalist’s question.

Labels (choose exactly ONE):
- Clear Reply: the answer directly supplies what was asked.
- Ambivalent Reply: the answer references the topic but is indirect, vague, partial, or hedged.
- Clear Non-Reply: the answer refuses, claims not to know, asks for clarification, or ignores the question.
Do not explain your reasoning. Return only one line with the label.

### KNN SELECTION — do not output
From the FEW-SHOT EXAMPLES above, internally compute semantic similarity between the INSTANCE TO CLASSIFY and each example
(using intent match on who/what/when/where/why/how, topical terms, and refusal/ignorance/clarification cues such as “won’t comment”,
“don’t know”, “can’t discuss”, “what do you mean”). Select top-k = 3 most similar examples; if ties, prefer label diversity across the k.
Condition your prediction only on those selected k examples.
