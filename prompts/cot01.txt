"Task: Judge the clarity of an answer to a journalist’s question.

Labels (choose EXACTLY ONE; final line must be one of these strings):
- Clear Reply
- Ambivalent Reply
- Clear Non-Reply

Labels (choose exactly ONE):
- Clear Reply: the answer directly supplies what was asked.
- Ambivalent Reply: the answer references the topic but is indirect, vague, partial, or hedged.
- Clear Non-Reply: the answer refuses, claims not to know, asks for clarification, or ignores the question.

Think step by step (show your reasoning), then output the final label.

Step-Back Reasoning:
1) State in one sentence what information the QUESTION is requesting (who/what/when/where/how/why).
2) Quote ≤20 words from the ANSWER that are most responsive.
3) Evaluate with three tests:
   - Directness: does the quote supply the requested info?
   - Topicality: is it on-topic vs. generic or shifted?
   - Non-reply cues: refusal / don't-know / clarification request present?
4) Decide the single best label.

Format your output exactly as:
REASONING:
- Target info: <one sentence>
- Evidence: ""<verbatim span>""
- Assessment: <1–2 short sentences>
FINAL_LABEL: <Clear Reply | Ambivalent Reply | Clear Non-Reply>

QUESTION:
{question}

ANSWER:
{answer}"
